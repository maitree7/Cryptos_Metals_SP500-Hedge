#### Question 1: How do the prices of each asset compare to eachother over a year. 

*Analysis shows that BTC-USD was by far the most volatile, and all the assets show significant drop in early 2020. 



#### Question 2: What are the risk profiles like for each column.

* Using STD, BTC is by far the riskiest asset of this past year, with ETH coming in a distant second. Silver and the SP500 had extremely similiar risk profiles, this is significant because the SP500 returns are from aggregated data, one would expect the low risk profile. Silver, as one commodity moved very little in the past year. 

#### Question 3: After analyzing risk and prices, what do the return profiles look like for the year? 

* BTC still has the best returns, while gold is a distant second. Silver and the SP500 track very closely, as do BTCASH and ETH which are near the bottom.
